:description: This section describes how to provide files for import using Neo4j Data Importer.
= File provision

In essence, you provide a set of files that contain the data to be imported and Data Importer imports them into Neo4j.

Data Importer supports flat files, i.e. files that contain data in a tabular format where each row represents a record and each column represents a field in that record.
The most common format for such files is CSV (comma-separated values), but Data Importer also supports TSV (tab-separated values).

Data Importer requires all files to have a header row and at least one row of data.
The header row speficies how the data in the file should be interpreted and contains information for each field.
For more information about CSV files and the header format, see link:{neo4j-docs-base-uri}/operations-manual/current/tools/neo4j-admin/neo4j-admin-import/#import-tool-header-format[Operations Manual -> CSV header format]
